namegenie
-------
namegenie is a simple utility to rename a PDF to the first line in the
document.  If the first line in the file, presumably the "title" of the
document, has spaces, they are replaced with the '_' character.

What is this good for?  Personally, I think it is pretty common that people
maintain directories of poorly named PDF documents.  While this tool isn't
perfect, it can help eliminate some of the naming confusion and make files have
a clearer name.  The goal: eliminate name entropy and defeat physics.


Usage
-----
Simply run the tool and give it a list of files to rename.
        ./namegenie crappy_name.pdf not_a_good_documentname.pdf blarg.pdf

The tool will query the user with a (hopefully) better name for the PDF file.
If the user likes the name, the file will be renamed to the suggested name.  If
the user provides a '-y' on the command line, then the tool will not ask the
user if it can rename the file, and will automatically rename instead.


Caveat
------
This tool is not perfect.


Dependencies
------------
libpoppler (PDF text extraction)


Building
--------
Simply run `make' which will produce (hopefully) the `namegenie' binary.


Installation
------------
The file can be copied anywhere, spread the magic.
